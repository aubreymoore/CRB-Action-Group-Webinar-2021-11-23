00:10:24	Michael Jordan:	Hello Everyone
00:11:18	Tek Tay:	G’day, greetings from Canberra Australia
00:15:00	Robert `Progar:	Hello All good to see/hear you
00:16:47	Madoka Nakai:	Sean, will you share this slide with us?
00:31:33	Madoka Nakai:	Which strain of virus will be used in Vanuatu?
00:33:36	Tek Tay:	Any idea how the CRB got onto New Caledonia and Vanuatu?
00:36:30	Bob Macfarlane:	If CRB came to New Caledonia by international aircraft do we know where it likely came from?
00:43:54	Madoka Nakai:	In New Caledonia only CRB-G were invaded, but in Vanuatu only CRB-S were invaded. Is it right?
00:44:27	Sarah Mansfield:	yes, that is correct Madoka
00:45:28	Pamela George:	Are you going to share the recording? I have visual but my laptop refuses to allow audio. 
00:45:38	Kayvan Etebari:	What does it mean to you (AgResearch)?
00:46:23	Trevor Jackson:	Yes we will share the recording - as for the previous meetiong
00:46:47	Pamela George:	Thanks Trevor
00:47:49	Madoka Nakai:	Thanks, Sarah. Is it mean that CRBs were invaded into those two islands from different origins?
00:48:56	Bob Macfarlane:	Do we know when CRB-G arrived along the N coast of mainland PNG. is it old or new?
00:48:57	Tek Tay:	Not necessarily Madoka, could be from a location where S and G are co-existing?
00:49:37	Kayvan Etebari:	@TeK Tay. That is right. Haplotyping by CoxI gene doesn’t tell us anything
00:51:18	Carmel Pilotti:	can you confirm CRB-G is becoming dominant in PNG?
00:51:34	Kayvan Etebari:	No
00:51:39	Sarah Mansfield:	Since we do not know for certain how CRB entered either New Caledonia or Vanuatu, it is not possible to pinpoint the source of these populations.
00:52:37	Tek Tay:	@Kayvan - ‘No’ for not becoming dominant or you don’t know?
00:53:09	Tanya Robinson:	Sean, I don’t think either Francis or Luke will be coming
00:53:39	Kayvan Etebari:	The current CoxI based method is not a reliable diagnostic marker for phenotypic traits, especially in countries such as Solomon Islands or PNG where the haplotypes have come back into sympatry and are admixed.
00:59:11	Christopher Kitalong:	So what method are people thinking for population genetics?
01:01:00	Kayvan Etebari:	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170219308123
01:02:54	Kayvan Etebari:	CRB-G is native to Philippines and Taiwan and is not a new thing!!
01:04:54	Michael Melzer:	HI Madoka,  I am discussing with Nelson tomorrow - sorry for the delay!
01:05:17	Madoka Nakai:	Thanks, Mike. I am waiting for your response!
01:11:22	Tek Tay:	What are cryptic breeding sites?
01:11:24	Sheri Smith:	Also, US Forest Service is providing some funding to War in the Pacific National Historical Park on Guam for CRB work.
01:12:13	Fereti Atumurirava:	Glenn, Where do you get your Metarhizium culture bagging from?
01:14:03	Fereti Atumurirava:	Glenn,  can you send us the supplier details please for the bag
01:17:09	Glenn Dulla:	Hi Atu, our metarhizium project starts in the next fiscal year. We have not started anything yet, sorry.
01:17:27	Madoka Nakai:	Thanks, Sarah, Tek Tay and Kayvan. 
@ Kayvan What is the better way to diagnose the haplotype in the mix area than CoX1?
01:20:13	Kayvan Etebari:	@ Madoka What do you want to learn from haplotyping?
01:20:45	Peter Maddison:	MILT STUNZNER DID SOME TRIALS ON INSECTICIDE INJECTIONS IN 1968 in the SAMOA CRB project
01:21:12	Mark Ero:	Hi Keith, what volume of insecticide are you injecting per palm?
01:21:37	Michael Melzer:	Hi Mark, depends on tree DBH
01:22:05	Tek Tay:	How do you monitor for insecticide resistance in the CRB ?
01:22:12	Michael Melzer:	We're using Ima Jet 10
01:22:15	Mark Ero:	Thanks Mike
01:22:45	Fereti Atumurirava:	Thanks Glenn. Getting the right type of bag for Metarhizium culture is our main constrain now
01:23:21	Michael Melzer:	Hi Tek, we are considering alternating between imidacloprid and acephate. Both appear to work in the lab.
01:23:46	Carmel Pilotti:	Atu, any type of polypropylene bag should be ok. I'll talk to you later
01:24:27	Tek Tay:	Thanks for the information Mike
01:25:35	Glenn Dulla:	Atu and Carmel, can you send me your methods and materials for culture. It will give us a head start on sourcing materials before the project starts
01:26:06	Fereti Atumurirava:	Sure Glenn, will do
01:27:49	Sean Marshall:	Hi Glenn and Atu, Laura Villimizar can also assist with some expertise for this too.
01:28:02	Madoka Nakai:	@Kayvan, Since the relationship between virus susceptibility and haplotypes has been discussed, we would like to clarify from what host our virus strain was isolated.
01:28:13	Jacques Idechong:	Aloha Keith, just curious if you folks have any molecular id's for your crb strains..
01:28:15	Fereti Atumurirava:	We are in desperate need of getting the contact details for Metarhizium mass production
01:28:43	Fereti Atumurirava:	mass production baggaging
01:29:27	Kayvan Etebari:	There is no scientific evidence to make a link between CoxI gene and resistance to OrNV
01:29:56	Madoka Nakai:	@Kayvan I agree with you.
01:30:06	Christopher Kitalong:	CoxI for population genetics only no?
01:30:10	Trevor Jackson:	Kayvan - I think we all agree on that point.
01:30:43	Kayvan Etebari:	I dont think so Tervor. You still using the term CRB-G as invasive
01:31:12	Kayvan Etebari:	The information out there is misleading the scientific community
01:31:29	Madoka Nakai:	@Kayvan It is a good point.
01:31:35	Kayvan Etebari:	It is time to move on from “Introduction”
01:31:55	Kayvan Etebari:	We need to discuss more important points in these kind of meetings
01:32:09	Kayvan Etebari:	Everyone here they know what is CRB
01:32:32	Kayvan Etebari:	But they dont know what is CRB-G!!
01:33:55	Kayvan Etebari:	Finding CRB-G in 2017 was great deal but now it is time to go forwards
01:35:21	Kayvan Etebari:	@AgRsearch team Is CRB-G a Haplotype or Biotype?
01:35:30	Jacques Idechong:	thanks Kayvan for the good point.
01:36:24	Madoka Nakai:	I'm sure the new haplotype (CRB-G) is invading new areas and killing palms. I want to know what makes the new haplotype different from other haplotypes.
01:37:07	Kayvan Etebari:	CRB-G in Solomon Island and CRB-G in Philippines are totally different
01:38:00	Sarah Mansfield:	This new review paper is available with open access from the journal, Annals of the Entomological Society of America.
01:38:00	Tek Tay:	@Kayvan - what is the evidence for this, are you able to share?
01:39:23	Madoka Nakai:	Sarah, let me the title.
01:39:24	Kayvan Etebari:	@Tek, sure, we used the GBS and RNAseq. I will share all our publication with group email
01:39:34	Darcy Oishi:	Sulav,  I’d enjoy discussing potential collaboration. I am eager to restart exploration for arthropod natural enemies once we can travel again
01:40:04	Tek Tay:	Thank you kayvan
01:40:05	Glenn Dulla:	Darcy just wants an excuse to travel....
01:40:16	Kayvan Etebari:	@ Trevor How do you know?
01:40:28	Kayvan Etebari:	Are you happy to share the data
01:40:49	Kayvan Etebari:	It is not true!
01:41:06	Sulav Paudel:	Here is the link to our paper: https://academic.oup.com/aesa/article/114/2/247/6127283?login=true it is an open access
01:41:06	Darcy Oishi:	Actually wouldn’t be me doing the travel Glen!  I’d just be bringing my hawaii germs to Guam
01:41:15	Sarah Mansfield:	https://doi.org/10.1093/aesa/saaa057
01:41:39	Sarah Mansfield:	Just posted the direct link to the paper
01:41:41	Kenneth Puliafico:	https://academic.oup.com/aesa/article/114/2/247/6127283
01:42:02	Kenneth Puliafico:	Link to Paudel's review paper
01:42:04	Kayvan Etebari:	Based on your report 92% OrNV infection rate in Samoa. What virus is doing there? Chronic infection! Persistence in the popultion!
01:42:46	Sulav Paudel:	Hi Darcy, sure. That would be great. This is my email: sulav.paudel@agresearch.co.nz We shall discuss
01:43:35	Darcy Oishi:	Sulav mine is Darcy.e.oishi@hawaii.gov
01:44:27	Aubrey Moore:	We need comarative bioassays to compare pathogencity of OrNV isolates between CRB-G and CRB-S. Until that is done, we don't know if we are dealing with resistant and suseptible populations.
01:45:03	Kayvan Etebari:	@ Aubrey do you have CRB-S in Guam?
01:45:13	Madoka Nakai:	I agree with Aubrey. That is what we also want to examine.
01:45:47	Christopher Kitalong:	Would like to have a large population study with all partners
01:45:59	Madoka Nakai:	Nobody done the comparative bioassay. We have been talking about it for 3 years!!
01:46:01	Kayvan Etebari:	That is right we dont have any data on CRB-S
01:46:08	Aubrey Moore:	We do not have CRB-S on Guam. 
01:46:16	Christopher Kitalong:	good to do in rearing facility in Japan
01:46:29	Christopher Kitalong:	or if available funding do it here in Palau
01:46:38	Kayvan Etebari:	What is the expected mortality? What is viability rate and PFU of the virus they use for bioassay!
01:46:47	Christopher Kitalong:	as we don’t worry too much about introduction of either S or G…
01:46:52	Madoka Nakai:	I hope Chris will bring them to us after getting quarantine parmission.
01:47:04	Kayvan Etebari:	Funding is not a problem!
01:47:12	Christopher Kitalong:	it is my problem
01:47:25	Christopher Kitalong:	as I am the only one working on it here at the moment
01:47:49	Trevor Jackson:	I agree that we need the comparative bioassays. This has not been easy in these COVID times.  But don't forget to include the pathology.  Presence of virus does not necessarily mean infection.
01:48:02	Kayvan Etebari:	Happy to help Chris
01:48:28	Kayvan Etebari:	We have the issue since 2015 and covid is 2020
01:48:59	Madoka Nakai:	My concern is how to inoculate viruses per on into larvae. If we can establish the method, we can examine the doses.
01:49:39	Madoka Nakai:	I meant how to inoculate virus from the mouth (per os) to the larvae. It may be the main route of virus infection at the larval stage.
01:49:43	Kayvan Etebari:	@ Madoka lets talk later
01:49:50	Madoka Nakai:	Yes
01:50:51	Christopher Kitalong:	sounds good
01:51:04	Christopher Kitalong:	any progress on cell line ?
01:53:07	Christopher Kitalong:	@kayvan, email at ckitalon@gmail.com
01:53:39	Kenneth Puliafico:	Sarlesh, did you try to combine the Orycta Lure with your new lures?
01:54:59	Kayvan Etebari:	sure
01:57:41	Mark Ero:	Yes we did, Kenneth
01:58:24	Kenneth Puliafico:	Was there any additive effects from combining the standard and new pheromone lures?
02:05:23	Kenneth Puliafico:	We also find a female bias in our pheromone traps
02:07:28	Tek Tay:	Question to Lastus - are the OrNV resistance status of CRB at these treated sites known? Are they mixed of G and S?
02:08:18	Mark Ero:	Kenneth, I thought there was because low numbers were caught in single lure trials.
02:11:29	Kayvan Etebari:	@Tek the absence of OrNV in CRB-G has been taken as evidence for resistance to virus in the haplotype group.
02:12:31	Tek Tay:	Thanks Kayvan, I was hoping to find out if the populations were mixed G/S or were they of specific haplotypes
02:13:20	Kayvan Etebari:	They dilute the DNA 1 to 5000 to detect the virus!! We think the population in PNG is also admixed
02:14:28	Kayvan Etebari:	This 1 to 5000 dilution of DNA induce false negative result in the PCR
02:18:00	Sean Marshall:	Kayvan you are cherry picking your points.... with respect to your comment on level of virus detected, when trap catching CRB there is a strong relationship between virus detected and time between clearing of traps.
02:19:24	Sarah Mansfield:	We also confirm virus infection through histology to check for symptoms of active infection. Our PCR results are extremely well correlated with the histology
02:20:55	Kayvan Etebari:	Virus infection and disease is two different things! A virus infected individual can be asymptomatic to virus
02:21:33	Kayvan Etebari:	Can you please provide the evidence for that why we need to dilute dna 1 to 5000??!
02:25:11	Christopher Kitalong:	If any questions to me please just type sitting in another meeting
02:28:11	Kayvan Etebari:	Thank you everyone! Looking forward to the next meeting! I hope we will be able to share our data and have a productive discussion.
02:31:22	Madoka Nakai:	I'd like to formally apologize for meeting you today, but the 2018 Gold Coast SIP review has been delayed. The content is out of date, but I'd like to submit it soon.
02:32:17	Nutan Kaushik:	iWork botanical  and ENDOPHYTE’s would be very happy to collaborate
02:32:43	Nutan Kaushik:	My Id nkaushik5@amity.edu
02:32:45	Sulav Paudel:	@Nutan: Good to see you here!
02:33:33	Madoka Nakai:	@Sulav It is very good to study on the physiological effect of CRB to the palms
02:37:39	Christian MILLE:	bye many thanks to all
02:37:53	Maria Sugiharti:	thank you
